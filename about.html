        <p>My name is Hunter.</p>
        <p>Hi, my name is Hunter, I’m 11 years old, and I decided to start a business of dog treats. I have a dog and she loves the treats I make her. 

The treats I made at first were not  as nutritious as I make them now. The first recipe was with eggs and flour which was not as healthy as they could have been, but I found a new recipe that had no eggs and oats instead of flour, which was much healthier. Plus everything that is on the ingredient list, is old fashioned, fresh, and organic. They have no weird oily stuff that’s unhealthy, like at the stores. So these treats are at the top of your dog's Christmas wishlist.

But you should note that there are no preservatives in them, so have your dog eat them within 10 days, or you can put them in the fridge and they will last longer.</p>
        <p>Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas!</p>
